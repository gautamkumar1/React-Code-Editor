The goal of the Tealfeed Assignment project is to create a straightforward yet powerful React-based code editor.  
Drawing inspiration from tools like Prism JS, the project utilizes advanced technologies including Prism JS for syntax highlighting and the Textarea HTML element to ensure a smooth coding process.  
By combining these features, users benefit from real-time syntax highlighting as they write code in the editor. 
This approach not only enhances usability but also mirrors the intuitive interfaces of leading code editors, thereby boosting developer efficiency.
